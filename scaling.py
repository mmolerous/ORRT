"""
FUNCTION: scaling

EXPLANATION:
 Given a data set, the goal of this program is to scale each of its predictor
 variables to the 0-1 interval.

USAGE:  (scale,M,m) = scaling(data)

INPUTS:
  data: an N x (p+1) numpy matrix, where N is the number of observations and p is
        the number of predictor variables. The last column should correspond
        to the response variable.

OUTPUTS:
  scale: an N by (p+1) numpy matrix after scaling 
  M: a p numpy vector with the upper scaling parameters
  m: a p numpy vector with the lower scaling parameters

COMMENTS:
  This program is needed for ORRT_D1.py and ORRT_D1_lambdas.py
